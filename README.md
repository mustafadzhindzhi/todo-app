# Project Title

Notes App

## Introduction

This is the Notes App that I managed to develop in 4 hours. For the front-end I used React.js, and for the back-end I used Node.js, Express and MongoDb.

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:
- Node.js installed on your system.

### Front-End Installation

To set up the front-end part of the project, follow these steps:

```bash
cd client
npm install
npm run dev
```


### Back-End Installation

To set up the back-end part of the project, follow these steps:

```bash
cd server
npm install
npm start
```


# To-Do

## Features that I Wanted To Implement If I had More Time

- **Drag-and-Drop Functionality:** Implementing drag-and-drop functionality would allow users to effortlessly move tasks between columns. This feature enhances user experience by providing a more intuitive way to manage tasks.
- **Inline Editing:** Enabling inline editing directly within the columns would streamline the task management process. Users could quickly update task details without having to navigate to a separate editing interface, saving time and effort.
- **Dynamic Column Resizing:** Implementing dynamic column resizing would enhance the flexibility of the interface, allowing users to adjust column widths according to their preferences or the amount of content within each column.
- **Customizable Columns:** Providing users with the ability to customize columns based on their specific workflow or preferences would enhance the adaptability of the app. Users could add, remove, or rename columns to better suit their needs.
- **Bulk Actions:** Implementing bulk actions such as bulk editing or bulk deletion would streamline task management for users with large lists. This feature would allow users to perform actions on multiple tasks simultaneously, increasing efficiency.
